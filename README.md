**GuessNumApp**: The user could manually input a 2-digits number and recursively adjust to increasing the decreasing the generated guesses until the two numbers become equal. The APP is primarily based on components, styling, and flexible layouts design (dimensions & platform API), which is responsive and adaptive to user interfaces, like orientation changes. The following [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ_brg4ggkE&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=%E5%BC%A0%E5%AD%90%E6%99%97) is run in iPhone 11 Pro (13.6). 

**MealsApp**: Dishes information (collected online) are elegantly presented, including the ingredients, duration, and making steps. Users could glance over different categories subpages, select their preferable foods, and add them into a separate Favorites page. Also, users could filter the meals, like whether they are gluten-free, lactose-free, or vegan, and only perceive partial results. React navigation and state management & redux are largely implemented in the code. The following [demo](https://youtu.be/jyTdsoep1Fs) is run in iPhone 11 Pro (13.6).
